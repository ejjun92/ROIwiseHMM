# ROI-wise HMM

This repository contains the implementation of our ROI-wise HMM. It has been written in Matlab. The details of this model are included in this [paper](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811918308280).


## Requirement

* **HMM Toolbox**

You will need to download the toolbox in this [site](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/Software/HMM/hmm.html). It supports inference and learning for HMMs with mixtures of Gaussians ouput.
